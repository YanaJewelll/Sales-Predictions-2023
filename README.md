# Overview
This project shows how visualizations and machine learning demonstrate the 20223 sales prediction at various stores. This also aims to predict future sales based on the given data. 

# Insights 
These metrics give us a good sense of how well the linear regression model is doing on both the training and testing sets. When the MAE, MSE, and RMSE values are lower, it means the model is doing a better job predicting the target variable. And if the R-squared value is higher, it indicates that the model fits the data well.

# Evaluation Metrics
The linear regression model is the preferred choice compared to the random forest regressor, showing superior performance in terms of various evaluation metrics on both training and testing datasets. It exhibits lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and higher R-squared values, indicating its ability to provide more accurate predictions for the target variable in the given dataset.
